	Summary- Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is one of the major tasks of NLP (Natural Language Processing). Sentiment analysis has gain much attention in recent years. In this paper, we aim to tackle the problem of sentiment polarity categorization, which is one of the fundamental problems of sentiment analysis. A general process for sentiment polarity categorization is proposed with detailed process descriptions. Data used in this study are online product reviews collected from Amazon.com. Experiments for both sentence-level categorization and review-level categorization are performed with promising outcomes. At last, we also give insight into our future work on sentiment analysis. 

Detect Anomalous User Behaviour on social networks[http://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/paper-archive/usesec14-facebook-subspace.pdf]
	Summary - Detect anomalous user behavior without a priori knowledge of the attacker strategy. The central premise is that attacker behavior should appear anomalous relative to normal user behavior along some (unknown) latent features. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique to ﬁnd these latent features. Section 3 describes PCA and our anomalydetectiontechniquein detail. In this section we ﬁrst build intuition on why attacker behavior may appear anomalous relative to normal user behavior (regardless of the speciﬁc attacker strategy), and overview our approach.
